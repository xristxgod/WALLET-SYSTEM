> This service will be a crypto wallet that is somewhat similar to `Trust Wallet` and `similar`. 
> But only in the telegram social network, for ease of work. My plans are to add such blockchain 
> currencies as (BTC, ETH, BSC, TRON and SOLANA) and, in addition to native currencies,
> their remaining tokens (smart contracts). The developer also has an admin panel, a service for monitoring prices 
> for cryptocurrencies (exchange rate). Buying and selling for real money. I have no deadlines and I'm doing it on pure
> enthusiasm. The code is completely open and you can take it. I plan to use all my knowledge and skills. And use 
> new telegram features such as `Payment platform`-`https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments`.

---
> Languages I use: `PYTHON`, `JS`, `GO`

> But it is based on Python and its frameworks: `FastApi`, `Flask`, `AIOGram` and others.
---

> `Admin` - Admin panel and admin bot

> `Bots` - The main bot and the bot for notifications.

> `Finance` - Working with finance and cryptocurrency.

> `Services` - Services for correct operation of the system.

To run the entire system, use: `Be careful, there are numerous bugs!!`
```shell
# Start
bash run.sh
# End
bash stop.sh
```
